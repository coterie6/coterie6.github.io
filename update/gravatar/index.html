    <h1>What is Gravatar?</h1>
    <p>Gravatar is a service that many websites use today to allow users to use one avatar across these different sites.</p>
    <p>The way Gravatar works is that you sign up on their website, linking your email to an image you'd like to use as your avatar.</p>
    <p>Websites such as this one can access that image based on your email address, and display it how they would like to.</p>
    <p>If you would like to customize your map icon, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, and set up an account.</li>
        <li>Go back to the <a href="../">"Edit your information" page</a>, select your name, and enter the email you used when you signed up for Gravatar.</li>
        <li>That's it!  If the image you chose does not display right away, that's okay.  Sometimes, the Gravatar server is a little slow, but your icon will show up eventually.</li>
    </ol>
